      "selected_projects_reasoning": "The 'Internship Trainee' role at Innovest Capital emphasizes analytical skills, market research, data synthesis, database management, and report preparation. While the candidate is pursuing an AI degree, the job does not explicitly require AI/ML development, but rather the underlying data-centric and analytical skills. \n\n1.  **DocuCare AI - AI-Powered Medical Document Management System**: This project was selected for its direct relevance to data synthesis, intelligent data extraction (OCR), and complex data querying using RAG. These capabilities are crucial for processing diverse information for market research or property reports, aligning with the need to 'synthesize data effectively' and manage data. It also showcases proficiency in modern software development ('other relevant software').\n2.  **Smart Student Job Agent Platform (Unihustle)**: This project directly addresses 'conducting market research' through its scraping pipelines and 'analytical skills' via the matching engine with weighted vectors. The robust PostgreSQL schema design is also highly relevant for 'maintaining client databases' efficiently and scalably. The use of Python, a strong analytical language, is also a significant plus."
