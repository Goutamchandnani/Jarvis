      "selected_projects_reasoning": "Selected 'DocuCare AI' as it directly showcases advanced AI/ML capabilities (LLMs, RAG, vector embeddings) for data extraction and insight generation from unstructured medical documents, which aligns with 'turning data into meaningful insights'. The use of Python-based AI pipelines is a direct match. 'Smart Student Job Agent Platform (Unihustle)' was chosen for its strong emphasis on Python, Flask (a key technology mentioned in the JD for API deployment), data scraping, PostgreSQL for structured data management, and the development of a data-driven matching engine. This demonstrates practical application of core data science concepts and tools. Finally, 'FlowerGen' from the generic CV is crucial as it demonstrates hands-on experience with Generative AI models (Stable Diffusion, LoRA) and Python, highlighting machine learning fundamentals and performance optimization, which are vital for an AI/ML focused data science role. These three projects collectively cover a wide array of requested skills from data processing and analysis to advanced AI model development and deployment."
