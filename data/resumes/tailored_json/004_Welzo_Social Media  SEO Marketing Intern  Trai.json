      "selected_projects_reasoning": "The provided job description is for a Social Media & SEO Marketing Intern, which is a significant departure from an AI/ML or Software Engineering profile. Most projects in the 'AVAILABLE PROJECT POOL' and the generic CV are highly technical (full-stack development, advanced AI/ML models) and not directly marketing-oriented. \n\nGiven the constraint to select from the 'AVAILABLE PROJECT POOL':\n1.  **DocuCare AI - AI-Powered Medical Document Management System:** Selected due to its 'AI-Powered' nature and medical domain relevance to Welzo (a healthcare marketplace). While technically focused on OCR, data extraction, and RAG, its elements of 'summarized insights' and 'interactive chat interface' can be spun to demonstrate an understanding of content processing, user engagement, and the potential of AI in future content/marketing strategies.\n2.  **Smart Student Job Agent Platform (Unihustle):** Selected for its 'data scraping' and 'matching engine' components. The ability to 'scrape external job boards' can be reframed as a capability in data gathering for market research, competitor analysis, or trend identification, which are vital for SEO and digital marketing. The 'matching engine' could be vaguely linked to audience targeting. \n\nThese projects are significant stretches, but they offer the most plausible (albeit indirect) connections to data handling, content processing, and domain relevance when viewed through a marketing lens, while also leveraging the applicant's technical background."
