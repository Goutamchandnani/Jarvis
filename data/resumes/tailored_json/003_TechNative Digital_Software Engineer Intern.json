      "selected_projects_reasoning": "The 'Software Developer Intern' role at TechNative Digital is a 'finishing school' for developers with existing coding skills in web development, focusing on React, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL, along with Agile methodologies and team collaboration. The selected projects directly address these requirements:\n1.  'Smart Student Job Agent Platform (Unihustle)': This project is a perfect match as it extensively uses React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and critically, a Python/Flask backend with PostgreSQL for the database – a specific skill mentioned in the job description. Its features like the matching engine and asynchronous worker pipelines demonstrate robust backend engineering and complex problem-solving.\n2.  'DocuCare AI - AI-Powered Medical Document Management System': This project showcases advanced frontend development with Next.js (built on React), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, all highly relevant modern web technologies. It also involves backend architecture (Supabase), secure data fetching, and API integration, proving comprehensive web application development skills crucial for the 'real-world experience' aspect, despite its AI component.\n3.  'KanSync | Real-time Collaborative Task Platform': This project directly demonstrates strong proficiency in Node.js and Express.js for backend development, along with MongoDB for database management and Socket.IO for real-time communication. By emphasizing its achievements in real-time features, secure authentication, and scalable architecture, it directly addresses the JD's need for Node.js and Express.js fundamentals. It also highlights solving complex web development challenges like CORS, which is valuable for practical experience."
