Its focus on AI for data extraction and summarization aligns well with potential 'cloud content scanning technologies'.\n'Smart Student Job Agent Platform (Unihustle)' was chosen for its demonstration of robust backend engineering, 'efficient' problem-solving (matching engine, asynchronous pipelines), data management (PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy), and scalability, all crucial for 'developing cloud services'. It also highlights a modern React frontend.\n'FlowerGen | Text-to-Image Generation System' from the generic CV was retained as it showcases advanced Generative AI skills (Stable Diffusion, LoRA) and Python optimization, which demonstrates proficiency in 'new technologies' and could be highly relevant for complex 'cloud content scanning' or data processing tasks, especially given the Master's in AI."
