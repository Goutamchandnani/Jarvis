'FlowerGen | Text-to-Image Generation System' further strengthens the AI/ML profile by demonstrating expertise in Generative AI, Stable Diffusion, and performance optimization, reflecting a deep technical understanding. 'Smart Student Job Agent Platform (Unihustle)' was chosen for its demonstration of complex system architecture, an 'AI-like matching engine' using weighted vectors, asynchronous processing, and robust data modeling, which highlights strong analytical thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to design intricate digital systems relevant to understanding and articulating patents in digital technologies. The generic KanSync project was less relevant for this specific role than these AI/ML and complex system design projects."
