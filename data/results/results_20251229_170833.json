It also showcases modern frontend development with Next.js and TypeScript. 'FlowerGen' from the generic CV is retained for its strong demonstration of core Generative AI model building (Stable Diffusion, LoRA) and GPU optimization. 'Smart Student Job Agent Platform (Unihustle)' was chosen for its robust backend architecture, demonstrating experience with asynchronous distributed systems (Celery, Redis), data processing, algorithm development for matching, and database management (PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy), aligning with requirements for scalable and fault-tolerant systems in a distributed environment using Python. The 'KanSync' project was deemed less relevant than these three as it primarily focuses on full-stack web development without a strong AI/ML component."
